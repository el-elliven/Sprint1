# **CUSTOMER-PRODUCT POS SYSTEM**

## **Overview**

This is a customer-product PoS system which is based on
customers, products, and purchases made
by customers. The main purpose of this project is to **implement a Python program that starts with a menu**, **get user choices**, and
**process the given choices**.

This program will assist in managing customer and product data in the
system, as well as enable customers make purchases of the products in stock. Therefore, the program will allow the user to create a new customer, update the customer information, search for a customer, and delete a customer from the system. Additionally, the user will also be able to add new products, update the existing products, search the products, and also delete products. Finally, with the customer IDs and product IDs in the system, purchases can be made.

**Language Used**: Python

**How to execute**: Run [main.py](https://github.com/Alex-Maina/Point-of-Sale/blob/master/main.py) file
